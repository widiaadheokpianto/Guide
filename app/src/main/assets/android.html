		<h2 align="center">HOW TO INSTALL MCPE MODS / ADDONS FOR ANDROID</h2>
	<p><b>Add-ons</b></p>
	<p><b>.MCPack, .MCWorld:</b></p>
	<p>
		Some add-ons are downloaded as a .mcpack / .mcworld file. These new file types automate the process of installing add-ons and maps.
		First make sure you’ve got the latest versions of ES File Explorer!
	</p>
	<p>
		1. Open the ES File Explorer app once you’ve downloaded an .mcpack or .mcworld file.<br>
		2. Go to your Downloads folder.<br>
		3. Find the .mcpack or .mcworld file and click it to import it to Minecraft Pocket Edition. The screen might go black for a while but just wait for it to load!<br>
		4. If you installed an add-on, don’t forget to apply the resource pack and/or behavior pack (click for instructions) when creating a new world or editing an existing world!<br>
	</p>
	<p><b>.ZIP, .RAR:</b></p>
	<p>
		If the add-on you downloaded is a .ZIP or .RAR then use the following tutorial:
	</p>
	<p>
		1. Make sure you’ve got the latest update for Minecraft Pocket Edition. It will only work for versions above 0.16.0.<br>
		2. Go to our section for add-ons and find one which you want to install. For this example we downloaded the More Chairs Add-on.<br>
		3. Next you will need ES File Explorer (or any other file manager app) to extract the downloaded zip file. You can find all your downloaded files in your Downloads folder. Long-tap on the zip file to select it. Then press the “More” button in the bottom right corner. And then press “Extract to”. A window should now pop up. Press “OK”.<br>
		4. Open the new folder which was created when you extracted the zip file.<br>
		5. Sometimes an add-on includes just one folder. But most of the time they will include two folders as it did in the case of the More Chairs Add-on. Copy the [Textures] More Chairs by Genta folder. To do that long-tap on the folder and then press Copy.<br>
		6. Go to the following location: /games/com.mojang/. You can get there by going to “Internal Storage” in ES File Explorer and then open the games folder, and then the com.mojang folder and there you will find the game files for Minecraft Pocket Edition. <br>
		7.  Open the resource_packs folder and paste the folder which you previously copied: [Textures] More Chairs by Genta.<br>
		8.  Go back to your Downloads folder. Open the add-on folder and copy the second folder: [Behavior pack] More Chairs by Genta.<br>
		9. Then go back to /games/com.mojang/ but this time open the behavior_packs folder and paste the copied folder here.<br>
		10. Start Minecraft Pocket Edition.<br>
		11. Create a new world or edit an existing world. In this case, we’ll create a new world.<br>
		12. Select all the game options you want and then scroll down in the left sidebar and tap on Resource Packs and apply the More Chairs Add-on.<br>
		13. Then tap on Behavior Packs in the sidebar and apply the More Chairs Add-on there as well.<br>
		14. Open the world. The add-on features obviously depends on which you installed but in this case it added a few different chairs to the game.<br>
	</p>
	<p><b>ModPE (BlockLauncher)</b></p>
	<p>
		IThe following tutorial works only for .js and .modpkg files.
	</p>
	<p>
		1. Download the BlockLauncher app: BlockLauncher Free or BlockLauncher Pro<br>
		2. Go to the mods section on MCPE DL and find the mod you want. For demonstration we’ll use the Achievements Mod. Click the download button.<br> Some of the download links will send you to an adf.ly page. To get to the download page press the top right button on the adf.ly website screen. <br>Different mods link to different download locations. In this case the download link brought us to MediaFire. Click the download link in the top right on the screen to get the .js file. This guide works for .modpkg files as well.<br>
		3. Launch Minecraft Pocket Edition and open up the BlockLauncher menu and select “Manage ModPE Scripts”.<br>
		4. Select “Import”.<br>
		5. Select “Local storage”.<br>
		6. Select the “Download” folder.<br>
		7. Select Achievements v1.1.js and it will install.<br>
		8. And it’s installed!<br>
		9. Then go back to /games/com.mojang/ but this time open the behavior_packs folder and paste the copied folder here.<br>
		10. Start Minecraft Pocket Edition.<br>
		11. Create a new world or edit an existing world. In this case, we’ll create a new world.<br>
		12. Select all the game options you want and then scroll down in the left sidebar and tap on Resource Packs and apply the More Chairs Add-on.<br>
		13. Then tap on Behavior Packs in the sidebar and apply the More Chairs Add-on there as well.<br>
		14. Open the world. The add-on features obviously depends on which you installed but in this case it added a few different chairs to the game.<br>

	<h2 align="center">HOW TO INSTALL MCPE MODS MAPS FOR ANDROID</h2>
	<p><b>Text Guide</b></p>
	<p>
		If you’ve downloaded a .MCWorld file then open ES File Explorer (make sure you’ve got the latest version) and then go to your Downloads folder. Find the .mcworld file and tap on it to import it to your game. The world should automatically launch in-game.
	</p>
	<p>
		If the above instructions don’t work then use ES File Explorer to rename the .mcworld file to end with .zip and then use the guide down below to install it.
	</p>
	<p>
		Please read the following guide if you’ve downloaded a .ZIP or .RAR file.
	</p>
	<p>
		1. To install Minecraft PE maps you need ASTRO File Manager (or any other file manager). Lets start by installing that app on your Android device.<br>
		2. Find an app in the maps section of our website. In this example we will show you how to install Skyblock PE. Click the download button to download the map.<br>
		4. Most of the times you will be redirected to another website, such as Dropbox or MediaFire, where you can download the map. At other times it will be downloaded instantly to your device. Normally the downloaded file is a .RAR or .ZIP.<br>
		5. Use ASTRO File Manager to open the .RAR or .ZIP and then copy the world folder to the following path: /storage/emulated/0/games/com.mojang/minecraftWorlds/. It might take a few seconds for it to process.<br>
		6. You have now installed the map and can safely close the file manager app.<br>
		7. Open Minecraft Pocket Edition (or restart the app if you had it opened during the map installation).<br>
		8. Look for the map in your world list. If it’s an old map it’s usually in the bottom of the list.<br>
	</p>
	<h2 align="center">HOW TO INSTALL MCPE RESOURCE / TEXTURE PACKS FOR ANDROID</h2>
	<p><b>Text Guide</b></p>
	<p>
		1. Go to our texture packs section and find a pack which you want to download. Try the ones which have been recently added or updated. In this example we will be using Faithful PE. It’s basically a high definition version of the Minecraft textures (64×64 resolution instead of 16×16).<br>
		2. Download and install ES File Explorer (or another file manager of your choice). Open the application and go to “Download”.<br>
		3. Here you should find the Faithful.zip file. Long-tap the file to select the file.<br>
		4. Then press “More” > “Extract to” in the bottom menu right corner of the application.<br>
		5. Select where to extract the file. In this case, we will select the second option: “Current path”. Then press “OK”.<br>
		6. Once the extracting process has been completed there should be a new folder in “Download”. In this case it is called vanilla.<br>
		7. Long-tap on the vanilla folder to select it. Then press “Copy” in the bottom menu.<br>
		8. Press “0” in the left sidebar. Open the games folder. Then open the com.mojang folder.<br>
		9. Click “New” in the bottom menu of the application to create a new folder called resource_packs.<br>
		10. Open the resource_packs folder. Press “Paste” to paste the previously copied vanilla folder here.<br>
		11. Open Minecraft Pocket Edition. Press “Settings”. Then select “Global Resources” in the left sidebar. Find and select Faithful PE in the list of available packs on the right side of the screen.<br>
		12. Go in-game to enjoy the new textures! As you can see, the Faithful textures is like a higher resolution version of the default textures. Pretty neat, right?<br>

	<h2 align="center">HOW TO INSTALL MCPE SKINS FOR ANDROID</h2>
	<p>We will guide you through all the necessary steps to learn how to install skins for Minecraft Pocket Edition. Changing the skin of your character will change how your character looks. Here on MCPE DL we regularly update our website with skins which you freely can download and apply on your character</p>
	<p>
		1. Go to the skins section on MCPE DL and tap on the download button for a skin you want to use. The skin will then be downloaded to your Download folder on your device.<br>

		3. Tap on the empty space next to the Alex and Steve skins.<br>
		4. Next a new button should appear above the player model called Choose New Skin. Tap on it once to open a file manager and select the downloaded skin. It’s most probably in your downloads folder.<br>
		5. Choose the model which looks best for the chosen skin. (Left = 3 pixel arms, right = 4 pixel arms).<br>
