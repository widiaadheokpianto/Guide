	<p><b>.MCWorld, .MCPack:</b></p>
	<p>
		Some add-ons are .mcworld or .mcpack files. If it’s a .mcpack file then a notification will appear letting you know if the pack has been successfully imported to your game. If it’s a .mcworld file then Minecraft Pocket Edition will be automatically launched and a world with the add-ons automatically opened.
	</p>
	<p><b>.ZIP, .RAR:</b></p>
	<p>
		If it is a .ZIP or .RAR then please use the following tutorial to install the add-on:<br>
		The tutorial is complete as it is, but we’ll make sure to add some more images and a video soon as well.
	</p>
	<p>
		1. Download and install iFunbox which is a free file manager software available for both Mac and PCs.<br>
		2. Plugin your iOS device into your computer using a data connection cord. It’s a standard iOS cable which usually comes with the device.<br>
		3. Browse our section for add-ons using your computer and find one to download. For this example, we are going to use the More Chairs Add-on.<br>
		4. Open iFunbox and click the “File Browser” tab in the top left corner.<br>
		5. Find your device in the left sidebar. You might need to expand the available items by clicking the plus symbol for “Connected Devices”. Then click on the “User Applications” icon.<br>
		7. Next you should see a bunch of different icons. Click the Minecraft PE icon.<br>
		8. Then a dropdown menu should appear. Click Open Sandbox.<br>
		9. Open the games folder and then open the com.mojang folder (still using iFunbox).<br>
		10. In this folder you should be able to see the following folders:<br>
		- behavior_packs (other addon related files)<br>
		- minecraftpe<br>
		- minecraftWorlds<br>
		- resource_packs (usually for textures)<br>
		- snooper<br>
		11. If you are using a Mac computer you can open the zip file which you previously downloaded for the addon simply by clicking the zip file. If you are using Windows then you will need 7-Zip (which by the way is a free software). Extract the zip file to get two different folders. Sometimes an addon includes just one folder and sometimes multiple. But in the case of the More Chairs Add-on it will include two.<br>
		12. Copy the [Textures] More Chairs by Genta folder and paste it in the behavior_packs folder (/games/com.mojang/resource_packs).<br>
		13. Then copy the [Behavior pack] More Chairs by Genta folder and paste it in the resource_packs folder (/games/com.mojang/resource_packs).<br>
		14. Open Minecraft Pocket Edition. Create a new world or edit an existing one.<br>
		15. Scroll down in the left sidebar. There you will see two new tabs. Press the Resource Packs tab and apply the More Chairs Add-on.<br>
		Then press the Behavior Packs tab and apply the More Chairs Add-on.<br>
		16. Enter the world and enjoy the add-on!<br>
